    <releaseNotes>[1.5.2] Initialized the indexes properly when persisted.
[1.5.1] Now persistin the indexes should be work.
[1.5.0] Added the ability to persist data locally after being retreived.
[1.4.0] Renaming the CustomGetAllQuery.cs and updating the builder to try and be a little more consistent.

[1.3.16] Created the CustomGetAllQuery because I can't seem to get the Massive one to work like I want.
[1.3.15] Fixed a bug when trying to use the GetAll strategy.
[1.3.14] Added a new GetAll strategy that will not throw when trying to retrieve bad values from a DataReader.
