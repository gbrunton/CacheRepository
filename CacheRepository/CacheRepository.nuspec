    <releaseNotes>[1.3.8] Fixed an issue when the delimited file might not have all of the delimiters on a line. 
[1.3.7] Fixed a problem with trimming when the value to trim is an empty string.
[1.3.6] Changed the .net target framework from 4.5 to 4.0. This will allow older projects to depend on this library.
[1.3.5] Fixed a bug within the Repository that would try and get a max id value when an insert is called even if the IdDoesNotExist strategy was declared. This was also causing an unnecessary select * query when ids are guids. 
[1.3.4] Made the SqlWithPassThruConnectionAndTransactionConnectionResolver constructor public. Otherwise its' not useful.
[1.3.3] Updated the nuspec
[1.3.2] Created the SqlWithPassThruConnectionAndTransactionConnectionResolver as a way to use this library with an existing IDbConnection and IDbTransaction.
[1.3.1] Updated FubuCore to 1.0.0.225 version.
[1.3] Added the ability to insert lines into existing text files by either overwriting or appending.
[1.2] Expanded the FileRepository's API to now allow you to insert lines into text files.
[1.1] Made entity id configuration not necessary for most cases.
[1.0] This is the initial release of the library.</releaseNotes>
